This is a project for the subject Artificial Intelligence on Embedded Systems.

The goal of this project is to use object detection to detect and classify objects in the RSUD20K (Bangladesh Road Scene) dataset, and then deploy the model onto a Pi Zero W.

The model successfully reached its goal but performance is questionable due to hardware and knowledge restriction.
